# SQL-Challenge

I have included an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or provided table schemas for all tables, ensuring a clear visualization of the data structure.

I've meticulously defined all required columns for each table to ensure data completeness, set the correct data types for each column, prioritizing data accuracy, established Primary Keys for every table, allowing for unique identification of records, referenced related tables and implemented Foreign Keys to maintain data integrity, utilized the NOT NULL condition where necessary, enhanced data quality and accurately defined the length of values for each column, ensuring consistency in data representation.

I've successfully retrieved the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee. For employees hired in 1986, I've listed their first name, last name, and hire date. I've identified and listed the manager of each department along with relevant details, associated each employee with their department number, providing details such as employee number, last name, first name, and department name, and for employees named Hercules with last names starting with B, I've listed their first name, last name, and sex.

I've displayed employee details specifically in the Sales department and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
Additionally, I've generated frequency counts of employee last names in descending order, providing insights into the distribution of last names in the dataset


This project showcases my proficiency in SQL, covering data modeling, engineering, and analysis. The focus has been on ensuring accuracy, completeness, and effective retrieval of relevant information from the database.
